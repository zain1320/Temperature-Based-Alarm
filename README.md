# Temperature-Based-Alarm

This project uses the ADC with the microcontroller to convert the values to digital form from the LM-35 temperature sensor. The LM-35 sensor gives out an analog voltage which is co-related to the temperature (Higher the temperature means higher the voltage for the output).
